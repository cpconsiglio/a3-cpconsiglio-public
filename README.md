Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The goal of the application is to be a todo web app which ties stored tasks to registered users stored in a database. It uses MongoDB, Express, and React to accomplish this.
Most of the challenges I faced were environment related. MongoDB for some reason doesn't work on Firefox, I accidentally committed node_modules, tailwind wouldn't install properly, I had to revert back to React 18 even though it defaulted to 19, etc. 
I used Passport - Local Strategy as was outlined in the original README.
I tried using tailwind but after getting frustrated with version inconsistencies, I opted for Bootstrap as I'm more familiar with it and it's very easy to use

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used Render to host the web app as I've used it for personal websites in the past. It's very easy to use and free for small scale projects.
